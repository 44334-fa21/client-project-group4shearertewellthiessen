						<p>Koreen Dow is the old shoe at Waubonsie that is still here after 30+ years. You know the pair that you have had for a long time. You might change the insoles(or management), but the shoe is still sturdy. You might change the
							shoelaces(color,
							length, style), but that choice is what ties and keeps the shoe together and gives it character. That's what keeps her at Waubonsie...it is a good fit!</p>
