	<h3> Koreen Dow, Administrative Director</h3>
	I am Koreen Dow, I am the old shoe at Waubonsie that is still here after 30+ years. You know the pair that you have had for a long time. You might change the insoles(or management), but the shoe is still sturdy. You might change the shoelaces(color, length, style), but that choice is what ties and keeps the shoe together and gives it character. That's what keeps me at Waubonsie...it is a good fit!
	<h3> Valerie Parrott, Billing Coordinator</h3>
