			hopes, dreams, and quality of life goals by delivering quality, integrated,
			trauma-informed behavioral health care.</p>

		<p style="font-size:24px;text-align:center; padding-right:30px;">Waubonsie Mental Health Center opened in 1982, and became an accredited Community
			Mental Health Center in 1984. Since that time, we have seen incredible growth
			within our organization- as well as in the people we serve!</p>

		<p style="font-size:24px;text-align:center; padding-right:30px;">WMHC offers a comprehensive set of services, ranging from outpatient therapy to
			drop-in peer support services. We currently have offices in Clarinda, Red Oak,
			and Shenandoah, Iowa.</p>

		<p style="font-size:24px;text-align:center; padding-right:30px;">The Center does not discriminate in regard to race, color, creed, national origin,
			sex, religion, age, sexual orientation, physical disability, or mental disability
			in providing services in any of our programs. </p>

		<h5>FAQ's</h5>
	<br>
		<details style="padding-left:50px;">
			<summary>HOW HAVE YOU ADJUSTED YOUR SERVICES TO ADAPT TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC?</summary>
			<p>At Waubonsie, the safety of our clients and staff is our highest priority.
				To mitigate the risk of a Covid infection occurring at one of our sites,
				we've implemented increased cleaning/hygiene measures throughout our facilities
				and have vastly expanded our telehealth offerings to offer services to clients
				from the comfort and safety of their own homes. Additionally, all staff, clients,
				and others entering one of our facilities may choose to wear a mask if that is
				their preference. Individuals exhibiting signs of illness at the time of their
				appointment will be provided with the option to receive services via telehealth
				from their homes.</p>

		<details style="padding-left:50px;">
			<summary>I'M UNINSURED OR CANNOT AFFORD MY CO-PAY, AM I STILL ELIGIBLE FOR SERVICES?</summary>
			<p>Yes you are! Waubonsie accepts private pay clients, with payment due at
				\check in. WMHC also offers a sliding fee payment scale to individuals meeting
				certain income requirements, which may partially or completely cover the cost

		<details style="padding-left:50px;">
			<summary>SOME OF THE THINGS I TALK ABOUT ARE VERY PERSONAL- WILL
				DISCUSSIONS WITH MY PROVIDER REMAIN PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL?</summary>
			<p>As an accredited Community Mental Health Center, we are legally and
				ethically required by HIPAA to protect your healthcare information.
				We will not release any information about your care- or even confirm your
				status as a patient- to an outside entity without your written permission.
				The one exception to this rule is in the event that we believe that there is
				a serious risk to your safety or someone else's. In such a situation, we would
				only provide pertinent information to the appropriate authorities required to
				ensure yours and others safety.</p><br>
