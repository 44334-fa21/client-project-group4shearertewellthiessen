	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>Waubonsie Mental Health Center strives to empower people to achieve their
		hopes, dreams, and quality of life goals by delivering quality, integrated,
		trauma-informed behavioral health care.</p>

	<p>Waubonsie Mental Health Center opened in 1982, and became an accredited Community
		Mental Health Center in 1984. Since that time, we have seen incredible growth
		within our organization- as well as in the people we serve!</p>

	<p>WMHC offers a comprehensive set of services, ranging from outpatient therapy to
	drop-in peer support services. We currently have offices in Clarinda, Red Oak,
	and Shenandoah, Iowa.</p>

	<p>The Center does not discriminate in regard to race, color, creed, national origin,
	sex, religion, age, sexual orientation, physical disability, or mental disability
	in providing services in any of our programs. </p>
